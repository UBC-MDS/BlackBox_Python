### Summary

The Bayesian vs Frequentist approach is more of a philosophical debate which this package will not delve into. This package attempts at breaking down the understanding and the underlying assumptions of the 2 approaches and how they compare. The package will run a significance analysis using both approaches based on data provided by the user.

This package is aimed at users who are attempting to familiarize themselves with the Bayesian/Frequentist approach(although I'm guessing it will be more Bayesian). This package can elucidate the difference in approaches and will attempt to help the user get a basic high-level understanding of both approaches and how they should proceed to carry out further analysis.


### Functions

Further analysis:

getCredibleInterval() : Perform Monte-Carlo estimation to obtain credible intervals

getConfidenceInterval() : Obtain confidence interval for the result

performABtest() : Run A\B test using Bayesian statistics

performHypothesistest() : Run a Hypothesis test using Bootstrapping/Permutation tests
